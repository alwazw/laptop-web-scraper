# Docs Index

This folder contains documentation and archival files for the project. Key notes:

- `Agent0-1.original.md` — archived initial claim file.
- `AGENT.md` — primary agent handoff (also available at repository root).
- `Potential Setbacks.md`, `Product Strategy.md`, and other design docs remain in this folder.

Please update this index when you add or reorganize docs, and reference updated docs from the main `README.md`.
